# S.H.O.R.T.

S.H.O.R.T. is a simple, NodeJS based url shortener.

A live demo can be found at [https://s-h-o-r-t.herokuapp.com/](https://s-h-o-r-t.herokuapp.com/), however, please keep in mind that because the demo version stores all links in memory instead of to a database and the webserver restarts every 8 hours (or when it is inactive), you should not use the demo as an actual url shortener, only for testing.
